# AirBNB_SQL_Project By Nishee Agrawal

This is a simple project to showcase my SQL skills using a NYC AirBnB dataset. After loading in the data, I created my own rating system to classify Air BnB listings as positive, negative, or neutral. I then grouped and ranked each listing to determine how good or bad (or neutral) they were.

After creating my queries, I pulled the data into Tableau and [created visualizations](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/nishee.agrawal/viz/AirbnbDashboard_17014595103350/Dashboard1) to better Visualize my findings.
